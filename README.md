**Cell**a **ex**plicatio amminicul**um** or cell analysis tool, is a specialized low-level program made to analyze cell counts along with some supporting information on fluorescence images of Nanotopography Screening Array (NTSA) interfaces, which is a set of different surface topographies on a single sample developed by M. Foss et al. (personal communication, 2023).
The program is made to analyze images directly taken from an Olympus optical microscope with cellSens (i.e. in .vsi file format).
